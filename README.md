# Bowling

This is kata of how Bowling points work: https://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/

Trying TDD(https://www.guru99.com/test-driven-development.html). It's the first time and I really enjoy it, made me change my point of view and at the beginning I was a little lost but when I realize how I should work suddenly I finished and wanted to try it more!!. 

Surely I'm going to use it in the future!!
